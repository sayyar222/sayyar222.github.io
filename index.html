            An adventurous 24 year old gearhead who thinks it's important to obtain basic coding knowledge in order to survive in the Bay Area. 
            I love my 2 year old German Sheprador more than most humans. I have an interest in basically anything that can go fast, from motorcycles to jets and everything in between.
            If I'm not in class or at work, I typically spend my free time roaming the rolling hills, local farmer's markets and the like. A lot of my experience lies in the automotive industry, though I'm enrolled in this bootcamp because I'm hoping to take a different direction in my life.
            I consider myself, and everyone else, a doctor of self. You have the power and the knowledge, though it may be undiscovered, to heal yourself of all physical, mental, emotional and spiritual injuries. 
            One of a million dreams of mine would be to start a non-profit organization someday, working directly with underprivileged kids.
